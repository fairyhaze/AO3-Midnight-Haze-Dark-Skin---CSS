## Customization

You can tweak the skin easily:

- **Background color:** Change `#060606` to any dark shade you prefer.  
- **Text color:** Change `#eeeeee` or `#bababa` to customize contrast.  
- **Borders & corners:** Modify `border-radius` values for sharper or softer edges.  
- **Highlight colors:** Adjust red for errors or yellow accents for notifications.  

## Notes

- Links and tags remain minimal with no underlines.  
- Alerts, errors, and notices are highlighted but not distracting.  
- Works on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Mobile layouts may need tweaks.  
- Designed for reading comfort and a clean interface.  


## Advanced Tips
  
- For developers: you can use `!important` on any element overrides if AO3 updates break the style.  
- To revert, simply remove the custom CSS from Appearance settings.
